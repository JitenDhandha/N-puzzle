# N-puzzle

A text-based N-puzzle (also known as sliding tile puzzle). To play the game, change the global variable `N` in the code to any dimension you would like and run the code! The 0 in the game-board indicates the empty tile, so input any tile around the 0 to move it. To cleanly exit the game at any point, enter 'q' or 'Q' as your input.
